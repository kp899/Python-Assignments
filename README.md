# Semester-1-Building-IT-systems
This is a repository of the code that I have written in my first semester of bachelor's of IT. This was my first venture into programming and all of the code has been written using python.
The First Assignment named my_stretchy_family was a project where using turtle graphics and function definitions in pythion we had to create 5 distinct figures and maek them stretch or shorten accoring to the function parameter which was a list. So it required a lot of work to be put in and a lot testing.

The two files named, top_ten and top_ten.db are the part of the second assignment where we had to get a top 10 list which was dynamically updated and not hardcoded, and also the ability to save those lists to a daabase. The project involved the use of GUI, Regex and SQL.

The third one was just simply an introduction exercise to GUIs in python as a part of thee weekly quizzes in this particular subject.
